# Allometry_FishSize_NeuralNetworks

This repository shows the calibration of an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict fish total length based on the allometric relationships of the fish eye and head (inputs). The species used as the case study is the reef fish Sebastes oculatus

Recent studies showed that the use of allometry, which refers to relative changes in the size of body parts, allows accurate size estimates of fish from still images and video footage. In particular, the ratio between the eye diameter and head height was proved to change proportionally to the fish's total length, and therefore the technique was successfully used to predict the size of fishes and other marine animals recorded by video.
