# Allometry_FishSize_NeuralNetworks

This repository shows the calibration of an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict fish total length based on the allometric relationships of the fish eye and head (inputs). The species of fish used as the case study is the Patagonian grouper Acanthistius patachonicus
